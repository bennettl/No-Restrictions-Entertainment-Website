	<h2 class="headline subheadline caps">Director's Statement</h2>
	<p>This film came about because ever since I first started reading newspapers I would always see an article about parents hurting or killing their children. </p>				
	<p>I kept trying to get the stories out of my head but there would be more and more incidents reported.  I wrote &lsquo;Mother&rsquo;s Red Dress&rsquo; based on some of those articles.  When the articles had photos of the abused children I would imagine the kind of life they would have had with if they didn&rsquo;t go through such horror. </p>
	<p>I spoke to child abuse professionals who pointed out that when children are in such trauma they create a fantasy world in order to survive.  After pondering on this I came to believe that we all create fantasy worlds to one extent or another to make it in this crazy world.</p>
