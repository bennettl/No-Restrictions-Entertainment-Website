		<div class="bio">
		<p>Alexandra Jane Swarens was born and raised in a small suburb outside of Sacramento, CA.  Being the youngest in a large family, she always tried to stand out, whether in sports or performing. She was in fifth grade when she decided she was going to become an actress, after seeing Audrey Hepburn in ROMAN HOLIDAY. In the seventh grade she told her parents she would be moving to Los Angeles when she became of age, and luckily, they were supportive. Two weeks after her eighteenth birthday she packed up all her things and moved to San Diego, where she went to school and studied Theatre Arts. At the age of 20, she decided that she had to leave her school career to really focus in on what she wanted. A month later, she was living in Los Angeles, where she started taking a variety of acting classes, working many jobs to get by, and auditioning for whatever she could. </p>
