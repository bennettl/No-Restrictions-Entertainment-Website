			<p>Based on a true story, ONE HOUR FANTASY GIRL is a compelling coming-of-age drama that is like no other film of its kind. Boldly honest and  thought provoking, the film introduces audiences to the world of a  twenty-year-old fantasy girl: Becky Lewis (Kelly-Ann Tursi), who escaped an  abusive alcoholic mother at the age of 15 and has been surviving on her own in  Los Angeles ever since.<br /><br /> 
			Having always struggled for money, Becky becomes business partners with Chi Trang (Paul D.  Nguyen), an aspiring musician, who convinces her to work as a fantasy girl,  acting out any fantasy a guy wants as long as there is no sex, no nudity and is  100% legal. She immediately gains two frequent customers, Roger (Jon Morgan  Woodward) and Bobby (Joe Luckay), who change her life forever.<br /><br />
			Becky finds herself in a web of deceit, betrayal  and murder that forces her to give up her own happiness. Shaken and bruised,  yet determined to make it, Becky pushes forward hoping to earn enough money to  invest in real estate and make the &ldquo;big bucks.&rdquo; Her journey leads her to find  an unlikely ally who, for a moment, gives her the break she&rsquo;s never had.</p>
