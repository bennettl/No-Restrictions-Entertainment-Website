				<div class="name">Brian Seikan Nelson</div>
				<div class="bio">
					<p>Brian Seikan Nelson&nbsp;was born July 4, 1985 and is the  second of four children. Both of his brothers are successful musicians and his  sister is currently attending college.</p>
					<p>	 Brian began editing video in high school as a way to get out  of doing live presentations. He ended up editing not only his own projects but  many of his classmates' as well. Eventually, what began as an excuse became a  calling. After high school, he moved to Hollywood to attend The Los Angeles  Film School and studied Editing and Cinematography.</p>
					<p>	After graduating, he gripped a few shoots and edited acting  reels and promotional videos. His big break came twice. First, he was hired to  edit the horror feature, &quot;Sin Jin Smyth.&quot; His second break came when  he was hired to edit the indie feature, &quot;Mother's Red Dress.&quot; It is  currently on track to be released in the Fall of 2011.</p>

				<div class="name">Christine Wu</div>
				<div class="bio">
					<p>Christine's professional career began at age 17. She has since played as a soloist and ensemble member all around the United States, Europe, and the Caribbean. Professional touring has taken her to Carnegie Hall as well as most of the well known concert halls throughout Europe. Christine studied violin at the University of Southern California with Robert Lipsett. During her final semester, she won a prestigious (tenured) full time position with the Houston Symphony Orchestra in 2001. In 2005, she made the unusual decision to resign from the world class symphony orchestra job. She studied record production and once she had mastered Pro Tools, she ran away from home to join the circus aka the Record, Film and Television industries in Los Angeles.</p>
					<p>Newly reinvented, Christine now works with producers, songwriters and bands to compose original string arrangements for rock, pop, country and urban records. She also works with composers, doing strings for film, television, trailers and jingles. Christine also writes original songs and records on several additional instruments, but we digress. Christine has worked on many major records, films and TV shows since returning to Los Angeles in 2007. She has also worked behind the scenes producing and editing vocals for recording sessions, using her perfect pitch, Pro Tools skills and quest for perfection to work with producers and mixers. Christine plays a 1782 Gragnani and a Violectra electric violin. Christine also records and composes on the cello and if pressed, the viola.</p>

				<div class="name">Mehdi Safa</div>
				<div class="bio">
					<p>It&rsquo;s been 4 years since transatlantic epic  rock explorers <strong>*shels</strong>, released their  debut album &ldquo;Sea of the Dying Dhow&rdquo; to critical acclaim. And since its release  the group have jettisoned their own imprint, Shelsmusic, and built a home for  some of underground alternative music&rsquo;s finest from around the globe -  including the likes of Black Sheep Wall, Latitudes, Ef, The Ascent of Everest,  Sons of Noel And Adrian and more. On the sidelines, <strong>*shels</strong> have been slow-roasting their sophomore full-lengther,<strong> Plains of the  Purple Buffalo </strong>with more care, detail and attention than anything  the band have ever undertaken. </p>
					<p><em>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s been a tough 4 years&hellip; juggling various different projects  along with the label, and our day jobs too - we&rsquo;ve been through some of the  greatest personal highs and lows ever and our lives have changed so much during  the writing and recording of this album&hellip; we've learned so much and tried to put  everything into these tracks&rdquo;</em> &ndash;  Mehdi Safa </p>
					<p>Produced  by Mehdi Safa at his home in Temecula, California, and taking its title from  the novel and movie The Neverending Story, <strong>Plains of the Purple Buffalo</strong> is a monumental journey, clocking-in just shy of 80 minutes. Piloted by the  songwriting force behind its previous incarnation as UK hardcore cult favorites  Mahumodo, <strong>*shels'</strong> niche lies in the  group&rsquo;s unique ability to seamlessly intertwine blistering slabs of raw  brutality with delicate and fragile passages - songs are more like film scores  and packed so richly, they overflow with emotion and energy. The attention to  detail and layers of melody has resonated with music lovers across all genres  and what makes <strong>*shels</strong> stand apart  form their peers. And in <strong>Plains of the Purple Buffalo</strong> <strong>*shels</strong> have taken their moody,  emotion-fuelled quest to Epic new plains.</p>

				<div class="name">Parliament of Owls </div>
				<div class="bio">
					<p>Closely  resembling the timid and elusive creatures they share their name with, <strong>Parliament Of  Owls</strong> would also prefer to sit unnoticed while transmitting gentle,  lo-fi lullabies into the noisy wilderness.</p>
					<p>Utilizing  short, delicate passages, <strong>Parliament Of Owls</strong> delivers an emotional and  haunting debut in &ldquo;Crow&rdquo;. Every segment carefully woven together using  apparently simple means &ndash; opting for a modest recording setup, consisting of a  few computer mics, laptop, front room and a few bottles of wine, the final  result is a collection of intimate lullabies more like audio journal entries.</p>
					<p>Although  frustratingly brief, every section of this debut connects with gentle yet  piercing potency and leaves the listener wishing for more. Fortunately, a 2nd  disc is provided courtesy of DJ/Producer <strong>&lsquo;Cignol&rsquo;</strong>,  which features longer electronic re-interpretations of each track.</p>
					<p>All  in all, this <strong>limited edition</strong> dual  disc features over 75 minutes music.&nbsp; The  release is planned thru Shelsmusic in the form of 100 <strong>hand-made/numbered</strong> copies (on CD) available at <a href="shelsmusic.com" target="_blank">shelsmusic.com</a> and  as digital download only.							</p>
